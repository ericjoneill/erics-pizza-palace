## What is Godfather's Pizza?
Godfather's Pizza is a fictional restaurant, for which I have created and designed a fully responsive website.

## Goals for the Website

1. Design a responsive website
2. Implement the use of icons
3. Implement some basic animations
4. Use Google Maps API to show location information
5. Create sticky navigation bar that will scroll on click and highlight when on section

### Technologies Used to Create Website

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. bootstrap
4. jQuery
5. Javascript

#### Problems I encountered and how I solved them
When making this website responsive in smaller devices, the elements in the About section would collapse in one another.
To solve, I used overflow: hidden; on the parent element, and then set a min-height to the child elements. After that I centered the element, that
was collapsing and then set a margin top to create space. -->
